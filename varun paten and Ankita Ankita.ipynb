    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Natural language processing research in social media continues to develop, with new tasks and datasets being introduced every year, but this fragmentation makes determining the state of the art in the field challenging because there is no standardised evaluation protocol or set of baselines for domain specific data to address this problem. \n",
    "* A group of researchers has created Tweet eval, a new evaluation framework that covers seven classification tasks, namely Emotion Recognition, Emoji Prediction, Irony Detection, Hate Speech Detection, Offensive Language Identification, Sentiment Analysis, and Stance Detection related to Twitter. They also provide a set of robust baseline models and evaluate several language modelling pre training methodologies.\n",
    "* Their initial results indicate that starting with pre-trained generic language models and fine-tuning on Twitter corpora can be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Social media networks creates massive amount of text data which makes it challenging to capture useful insights without the help of advance natural language processing techiniques. Addressing this problem could help us to analyse social media text and understand public sentiment, opinions, and behavior.\n",
    "* Modern NLP systems are typically ill-equipped when applied to noisy user-generated text. The high-paced, conversational and idiosyncratic nature of social media, paired with platform-specific restrictions (e.g., Twitter’s character limit), requires tackling additional challenges.\n",
    "* In other more generic contexts, these challenges can be considered solved or are simply non-existent.\n",
    "* Moreover, other apparently simple tasks such as sentiment analysis have proven to be hard on Twitter data (Poria et al., 2020), among others, due to limited amount of contextual cues available in short texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The drawback of other approaches is it's inability to perform tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The main reason behind it is the limited amount of contextual cues available in short texts, which makes tasks difficult, such as analyzing writer's sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The above mentioned problems has been solved by creating TWEETEVAL.\n",
    "* Various pre-trained language models have been used as baselines for TWEETEVAL, including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, ELECTRA, and Longformer.\n",
    "* The models were trained and evaluated on a variety of datasets, including public datasets such as SemEval, OffensEval, and EmoReact, as well as new datasets specifically created for TWEETEVAL.\n",
    "* The Twikenizer tokenizer was used, which is Twitter-specific and provides better performance than the original Roberta-base tokenizer on tweet data."

    "# Conclusion and Future Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "* This project taught me about the difficulties of natural language processing on social media sites, particularly Twitter, as well as the fragmented landscape of assessment methods for various classification tasks.\n",
    "* Moreover, I learnt that examination of various language modelling pre-training methodologies and training them could be beneficial and effective.\n",
    "* The project's limitations include the fact that it mainly focuses on English tweets and that the evaluation is based on a small number of datasets.\n",
    "* To better represent the heterogeneity and complexity of social media text, future research can extend the TWEETEVAL framework to additional languages and incorporate more diverse datasets."
